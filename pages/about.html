<div class="hobbies" data-aos="fade-up">I like to read about psychology and neuroscience to learn productive habits that I can apply to myself. I have various pairs of sunglasses to match the colors I wear. I also like to travel to various places to shoot portraits to practice my visual creativity. My desire to practice design, photography, and film-making stemmed from my love for the cinematic art form. </div>

  <div class="column" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="personalstatement">I first chose to specialize in machine learning as a cognitive science major for simple reasons: I loved reading articles and watching videos on different aspects of psychology and I knew I wanted to learn to code. For a while, I hadn’t given much thought about the specific kind of IT career I wanted to pursue, but the more classes I took, the more I learned about the applications of data science and the building blocks of artificial intelligence. Knowing that my curiosity wasn’t as strong towards data science as it was towards cognitive science, I wanted to find a reason that would incentivize it. Luckily, my creative hobbies guided me towards this incentive in the form of computer vision: the perfect marriage of data science and my longtime passions for photography and videography. I discovered my personal desire to contribute to the advancement of camera technology and the replication of the visual system through the knowledge I’d gain from my undergraduate program.</div></div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="personalstatement">After my first year, I taught myself more about what I could do with Python and complete YouTube tutorials on computer vision projects to supplement my learning. I began scouting online for start-ups that were getting press coverage to look for internships and expanding my professional connections by cold-messaging professionals in the field to ask about their careers. I attended office hours every week with one of my data science professors to ask her about her experiences. The palette of my curiosity later expanded to cover deepfakes and its applications for businesses and entertainment. I devoured video after video on how they’re made, their effects on society, as the technology is often used for malicious purposes. I tried out different apps and websites that made deepfake videos to experiment with them. The idea of replicating someone’s presence in a video or recording fascinated me just as much as replicating the visual system.</div></div>

  <div class="column" data-aos="fade-up"><div class="personalstatement">It wasn’t long until something else accompanied my curiosity as the driver of my motivation. My interest in psychological self-care took a dive into grief therapy and trauma after my mom passed away a year later. I looked around online for ways my interests could contribute to it. Knowing that I still had pictures of my mom and her voice recordings from our texts, I read about HR departments using deepfake AI avatars for training videos and scammers synthesizing people’s voices on the phone to trick others into transferring money over to them. I explored AI chatbot apps like Replika and Wysa to see how they incorporate cognitive behavioral therapy techniques for users. These discoveries made me realize my desire to use computer vision to heal others.</div></div>

<div class="hobbies" data-aos="fade-up">Artificial intelligence brought upon a new wave of advancement in every industry. The healthcare industry has used it to systematically detect illnesses and innovate vaccines. The tech industry has used it to optimize user experience and make leaps in image processing. The contributions that could be made in the mental health sector inspire me to combine all my skills into bringing my own wave of advancements. </div>
